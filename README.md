# Network motif analysis
## Tool for creation of and analysis of connection motifs within model networks

1. create spatially embedded model networks with parameterized connection probabilities (i.e., distance dependent)
2. store connectivity in database (???)
3. motif analysis: sample motifs (distributed possible???)
4. create jupyter notebook illustrating network creation and analysis flow
